# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake Game built using Java's `javax.swing` library. The game implements a classic snake game, where the snake grows in length as it eats apples. The objective is to control the snake and prevent it from colliding with the walls or its own body.

## Features

- **Randomly Generated Apples**: Each time the snake eats an apple, it grows longer and a new apple is spawned.
- **Simple Controls**: Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake (left, right, up, down).
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the current score based on the number of apples eaten.
- **Game Over Screen**: Shows a message when the game is over and the final score.
